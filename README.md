# fsjs-exercises

This is where I will track progress for ALL exercises for the full-stack javascript Alchemy class.

See different branches for different exercises.

create a Car class in Car.js and Car.test.js
Car has a make, model, year, color, miles
make, model, year, color are passed to the constructor
miles is set at 0 initially
test that a new Car has the expected make, model, year, miles, and color properties
Car has a drive method that takes drivenMiles
increment the miles property by the drivenMiles parameter
test after calling drive that miles is what you expect
Car has a makes static methods
makes returns an array of valid car makes (e.g. 'Honda', 'Ford', etc.)
BONUS: Update Car constructor so if make is not a valid make (from your makes static method), it throws an error
